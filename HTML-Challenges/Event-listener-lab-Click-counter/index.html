<!-- In this lab you'll be building a simple click counter using JavaScript

Your application will include a button and a display area (paragraph). Every time the button is clicked, a counter will increase by 1, and the updated count will be shown in the display area.

Steps:
Identify Elements: Locate the button and the paragraph in your HTML using their IDs. These are the elements you'll interact with in your JavaScript code.
2.Initialize Counter: Set up a variable in your JavaScript to keep track of the number of clicks. Initially, this will be set to zero.

Create Function to Update Counter: Write a JavaScript function that increases the counter each time it's called. This function should also update the paragraph element with the new counter value.

Attach Event Listener: Connect an event listener to the button. This listener should respond to 'click' events by calling the function you wrote to update the counter. -->
